Collecting stream height via an ultrasonic sensor connected to a BeagleBone Black and communicating it to web server


Environment variables
---------------------



Sensor sampling 
  Environment variables that are used to define valid sampling ranges
  for the sensor, and to make sure the correct sensor is setup.

  - ``GAGE_SERIAL_PORT`` - Serial Port dev path of sensor to sample (default ``'/dev/ttyS2'``)
  - ``GAGE_SERIAL_UART`` - Serial Port UART name of sensor (default ``'UART2'``)
  - ``GAGE_STORAGE_MOUNT_PATH`` - Path to where the ÂµSD card will be mounted (defaults to ``'/mnt/gagedata'``, currently shouldn't be changed)
  - ``GAGE_DATA_CSV_FOLDER`` - Folder where logger data should be stored (default ``'/mnt/gagedata/logs/'``.
  - ``GAGE_FILE_LOG_FOLDER`` - Folder where system logs should be stored in a rotating file ``'/mnt/gagedata/syslogs/'``.
  - ``GAGE_MAX_LOG_FILES`` - Maximum number of rotating log files that should be stored (default 10).
  - ``GAGE_SAMPLE_WAIT`` - Time to wait between collecting each sample (in seconds, default ``5``)
  - ``GAGE_MIN_VOLTAGE`` - If the battery is below the voltage, the gage will power off early and sleep for ``GAGE_MIN_VOLTAGE_RESTART_TIME`` (Default 3.0). 
  - ``GAGE_CELL_TYPE``
  - ``GAGE_SAMPLES_PER_RUN``
  - ``GAGE_PRE_SHUTDOWN_TIME``
  - ``GAGE_MAX_UPDATE_WAIT``
  - ``GAGE_SENSOR_LOW`` - Lowest valid value from the sensor (default ``501`` for using `Maxbotix MB7386`_)
  - ``GAGE_SENSOR_HIGH`` - Highest valid value from the sensor (default ``9998`` for using `Maxbotix MB7386`_)
  - ``GAGE_MIN_SAMPLES``
  - ``GAGE_MAX_ATTEMPTS``
  - ``GAGE_MAX_STD_DEV``


Power control
  Environment variables that control how long the gage is on and off
  as it goes through the day. Mostly used to control the `AndiceLabs Power Cape`_.
  `Power Cape watchdog information`_

  - ``GAGE_POWER_CONSERVE`` - Should the gage shut down and go into power conservation mode between sampling sets
  - ``GAGE_RESTART_TIME``
  - ``GAGE_MIN_VOLTAGE_RESTART_TIME``
  - ``GAGE_WATCHDOG_RESET_TIMEOUT``
  - ``GAGE_WATCHDOG_POWER_TIMEOUT``
  - ``GAGE_WATCHDOG_STOP_POWER_TIMEOUT``
  - ``GAGE_WATCHDOG_START_POWER_TIMEOUT``
  - ``GAGE_STARTUP_REASONS``
