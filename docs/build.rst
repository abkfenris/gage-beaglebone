Building
========

After you've chosen a site, and figured out if there is cell coverage, and hopefully gotten permission from your local Department Of Transportation, it's time to build a gage for that site.

Parts to acqure
---------------

BeagleBone
~~~~~~~~~~

The core computer controlling the whole system is a BeagleBone.
I've tested a BeagleBone Black, and I believe the BeagleBone Green will work the same, and even be easier to setup (in addition to being less expensive).

- `BeagleBone Black`_ Rev C ($55) or `BeagleBone Green`_ ($39) which comes with other goodies that are helpful like a baseplate that can be screwed or bolted to something.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have Sprint coverage, then Ting makes for a reasonable MVNO. 
I've tested with a Sierra 250U modem which is avaliable used for as low as $5.

- `Sierra 250U`_ ($10 - 60)

Storage
~~~~~~~

The BeagleBone uses a ÂµSD card for storage and initial programming.
I'm currently using 16 GB card, which is largely overkill.

- `SanDisk 16 GB Ultra MicroSDHC`_ ($10)


Power Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rob at AndiceLabs makes an expansion board for the BeagleBone, what is commonly called a cape for power management, including solar charging, starting up on command, and keeping a clock when the board is shut down.

- `Andicelabs 1A Power Cape`_ ($60)
- `Stacking Connectors`_ ($6)


Battery
~~~~~~~

I've tested the gage with the 6.6 Ah battery pack from Adafruit, but it should also work well with a more powerful 1S (3.7 V) battery pack that has a protection circuit.

- `3.7V 6600mAh Lithium Ion Battery Pack`_ ($30) Also can be ordered from AndiceLabs.
- `3.7V 10Ah Lithium Ion Battery Pack`_ ($64)


Solar
~~~~~

Voltaic Systems makes a nice series of solar panels and connectors

- `9 Watt Solar Panel`_ ($79 each) Possibly two panels for shady locations (most).
- `M3511 Splitter`_ ($6) If using two panels.
- `Extension with Exposed Leads`_ ($4) Makes for a nice clean, no outside soldering needed connection.
- `Edge Mounts`_ ($4) Makes it easier to mount two panels side by side.

Case
~~~~
Using a simple water resistant case from Amazon.
Could use something much smaller.

- `Orbit 57095 Sprinkler System Box`_ ($33)


Ultrasonic Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally the sensor, which is a `MB7386 Ultrasonic Rangefinder`_ from Maxbotix which will give 10 meters of range and was reccomended by the company after trying others.

- `MB7386 Ultrasonic Rangefinder`_ ($120)
- `MB7950 Mounting Hardware`_ ($3)
