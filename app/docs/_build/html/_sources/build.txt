Building
========

After you've chosen a site, and figured out if there is cell coverage, it's time
to build a gage for that site.

Parts to acqure
---------------
I've sorted the parts needed to build the exact same gage out by the same source
that I've bought them from, but some can be found elsewhere too.

Adafruit
~~~~~~~~
Adafruit is a great place for basic geeking supplies, from a soldering iron
(which you may also need to acquire, I got the `Ladyada's Electronic Toolkit`_
for my soldering iron, multimeter and other basic tools. )

- `BeagleBone Black`_ Rev C or `Adafruit BeagleBone Black Starter Pack`_ which comes with other goodies that are helpful like a baseplate that can be screwed or bolted to something.
- `Maxbotix Weather-Resistant Ultrasonic Rangefinder`_
- `6V 5.6W Solar Panel`_
- `3.7V 6600mAh Lithium Ion Battery Pack`_
- `Beaglebone Proto Cape`_
- `Adafruit Bi-directional Level Shifter`_
- `NPN Transistor`_

Amazon
~~~~~~
- `Orbit 57095 Sprinkler System Box`_

Maxbotix
~~~~~~~~
You could also order the Ultrasonic Rangefinder MB7092 XL direct from Maxbotix.
I do believe that they may have some sensors that don't need to have an inverter
that this current model does.

- `MB7950 Mounting Hardware`_

Andicelabs
~~~~~~~~~~

- `Andicelabs Power Cape`_
- `Stacking Connectors`_


Digikey
~~~~~~~

- `10K Ohm Resistor`_
- `1K Ohm Resistor`_
